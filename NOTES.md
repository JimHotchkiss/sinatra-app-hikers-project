~ Right or wrong, I decided to review some html and css first.  In addition to the  functionality of this MVC app, I want to offer some simple styling
~ I create a repository on GitHub, and have made a few initial commits, adding a README, .gitignore, index.html and an images folder.
~ I was able to open index.html in the browser (and spent way too much time patting myself on the back for that one).
~ I am now looking at the file structure of a Sinatra app, and thinking about the gems I will need.  
~ So, got some basic MVC file structure going, adding app/controllers/models/views, with corresponding application_controller.rb, model.rb and views.erb files.
~ Going to start with config/environment.rb
~ Now doing Gemfile
~ Now config.ru
~ Additionally, added some code, using the nyc-sinatra as a model, to the ApplicationController
~ Now add, ActiveRecord::Base to model
~ Now, addinga Rakefile
  * Ran bundle install  ~ got Gemfile.lock
